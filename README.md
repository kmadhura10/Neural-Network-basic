# Neural-Network-basic
Implementation of Neural network

It is single layer neural network implmentation where a single neuron (perceptron) has 3 inputs which are binary digits and it gives a single output as binary output.

In this implementation, used libraries - 'Numpy'

Then calculated synaptic weights of perceptron before and after training the system. 
on the basis of this, calculated sigmoid function by giving weighted sum as an input.

finally, gave the set of new input to test the system and saw the resulted output.
